Hello,

My name is Victor. I am a Computer Engineer graduated at the University of Campinas. 
At this moment I waiting for my viva to finish my PhD at the University of Birmingham, UK.

I have experience analysing different types of data, integrating them, creating model and interpreting the results.

In this blog you'll find some notes on different things I have explored, some things I have learned and I hope these notes can help you solve some of your problems as well.
